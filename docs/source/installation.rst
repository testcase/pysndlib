Installing pysndlib
=========================

If you use pip, you can install pysndlib with:

:: 

    pip install pysndlib
    
    
This currently supports macOs (Intel and Arm) as well as x86-64 Linux and python versions 3.10 and 3.11
 
I would suggest using a virtual environment. `Here <https://dev.to/bowmanjd/python-tools-for-managing-virtual-environments-3bko#howto>`_ is a good guide.
